#CONTENT TYPE DEFINITIONS

##ACTIVITY

An **activity** is an outdoor pursuit that can be performed by the general public and ultimately benefits Wildlife Resources’ mission of conserving, enhancing and promoting wildlife.

The promotion of these activities on the website—and when, where and how the public can take part in them—must be justified in at least one of two ways:

1. The activity itself will generate revenue for Wildlife Resources via a license, permit, pass, admission or fee.
2. It can be strongly argued that while the activity does not implicitly require the public to make a purchase from Wildlife Resources (though it could in certain contexts), the activity can readily be associated with activities that do.

For example, it is possible for kayakers and other types of paddlers to pass through a Wildlife Resources property without having to purchase a GORP permit. However there is also significant number of paddlers that the agency can expect a financial return from:

- Those who do need to purchase GORP permits so that they can launch or come ashore within the area
- Or those who will purchase a fishing license so that they can engage in both pursuits at the same time.

Activities cannot be designated on a map as they could encompass the entire property or could overlap with a particular feature on the property. For instance, *Fishing* is allowed practically everywhere on a Public Fishing Area. *Hiking* would overlap the feature *Hiking Trail*.

###EXAMPLES INCLUDE:

##FEATURE

A **feature** is any stand-alone facility, structure or part of the natural landscape that directly supports Wildlife Resources’ designated activities. These items can be represented on a map as an area, a line or a point/symbol/icon.
For the public, the promotion of these items on the website will help characterize the experience they will have on Wildlife Resources’ properties and also allow them to find locations that offer the features they desire.

###EXAMPLES INCLUDE:

- **A Type of Water-body:** Stream, River, Lake, Reservoir
- **A Variety of Trail:** Nature Trail, Interpretive Trail, Equestrian
- **A Kind of Shooting Facility:** Archery Range, Firearms Range
- **A Class of Boat Ramp:** Large Ramp, Small Ramp, Hand Launch
- **A Campground Designation:** Primitive Backcountry Campsite

##AMENITY (vs. FEATURE)

An **amenity** improves a customer’s comfort in using a feature or taking part in an activity. Amenities are unlikely to be the criteria that the public will use to identify an opportunity for an activity therefor they will not appear verbally on the website. Instead, these items are best represented on a map either as symbols or text.

###EXAMPLES INCLUDE:

- Restrooms
- Parking Areas
- Trail Shelters
- Fish Cleaning Stations

##EVENT

An **event** is an organized happening, held regularly and produced in part or in whole by Wildlife Resources, that promotes public participation in and/or support of the division's mission specific activities or its programs and initiatives. The public must be able to engage in an event as a student, registrant/attendee, spectator, volunteer, donor, license holder or recipient. 

An event's purpose and details should be relevant and accessible year-round, while its specific dates and locations are to be conveyed through a separate calendar. 

Events are sometimes orchestrated primarily by an external organization. Therefore information about these events is already availble on the organization's website. Whenever possible, the public should be directed to existing sites as the source for event information. Information specific to and necessary for events in Georgia can be listed on the Wildlife Resources website.

###EXAMPLES:

- JAKEs Day
- Free Fishing Days
- Hunter Education Sessions
- Summer Camps
- NASP Tournaments
- Project Wild Workshops


##PROGRAM

A **program** is an organized and structured effort, initiative, campaign, unit or section within Wildlife Resources Division that strives to conserve, enhance or promote wildlife. 

The inclusion of programs on the website must be justified in at least one of two ways:

1. The public may interface with program staff or witness their professional duties in pursuit of an activity.
2. The supporting program makes an activity possible.
 
A supporting program is not a Service (see description).

A program often has an official name, and sometimes, a logo, such as the Go Fish Georgia Initiative. 
Sometimes supporting program are “owned” by an external organization with its own website. Whenever possible, this existing website should be utilized as the default source of information on the program. Information specific to and necessary for Georgia can be listed on the Wildlife Resources website. Links to external sites should open in new windows to prevent losing the visitor. 

###EXAMPLES INCLUDE:

- Game Management
- Go Fish Georgia Initiative
- Nongame Conservation
- Prescribed Fire
- The Stream Team

##SERVICE

A **service** is performed by a professional for the benefit of an individual or a corporate entity. For the division to perform these services, there is a hard cost; therefore services are often accompanied by a fee or entirely provided by an outside vendor.

###EXAMPLES INCLUDE:

- The Sale of Licenses
- Issuance of Vessel Registrations
- Issuance of Special Permits
- Wildlife Removal Services
- Wildlife Rehabilitation Services
- Landowner Services
- Sale of Fish for Stocking 
- Processor and Taxidermist Services
