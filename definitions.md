#CONTENT TYPE DEFINITIONS

##ACTIVITIES

An **activity** is an outdoor pursuit that can be performed by the general public and ultimately benefits Wildlife Resources’ mission of conserving, enhancing and promoting wildlife.

The promotion of these activities on the website—and when, where and how the public can take part in them—must be justified in at least one of two ways:

1. The activity itself will generate revenue for Wildlife Resources via a license, permit, pass, admission or fee.
2. It can be strongly argued that while the activity does not implicitly require the public to make a purchase from Wildlife Resources (though it could in certain contexts), the activity can readily be associated with activities that do.

For example, it is possible for kayakers and other types of paddlers to pass through a Wildlife Resources property without having to purchase a GORP permit. However there is also significant number of paddlers that the agency can expect a financial return from:

- Those who do need to purchase GORP permits so that they can launch or come ashore within the area
- Or those who will purchase a fishing license so that they can engage in both pursuits at the same time.

Activities cannot be designated on a map as they could encompass the entire property or could overlap with a particular feature on the property. For instance, *Fishing* is allowed practically everywhere on a Public Fishing Area. *Hiking* would overlap the feature *Hiking Trail*.
